New features
------------

* Support for ``Text`` panels
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/63)
* ``PromGraph`` is now more powerful.
  If you want to pass extra parameters like ``intervalFactor`` to your
  targets, you can do so by listing targets as dictionaries,
  rather than tuples.
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/66)
* Support for absolute links to drill-down in graphs
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/86)

Changes
-------

* Breaking change to ``weave.QPSGraph()`` - added ``data_source``
  parameter and removed old hard-coded setting.
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/77)

Extensions
----------

Generally adding more parameters to existing things:

* Graphs can now have descriptions or be transparent
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/62 https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/89)
* New formats: "bps" and "Bps"
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/68)
* Specify the "Min step" for a ``Target``
  using the ``interval`` attribute.
* Specify the number of decimals shown on the ``YAxis``
  with the ``decimals`` attribute
* Specify multiple ``Dashboard`` inputs,
  allowing dashboards to be parametrized by data source.
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/83)
* Templates
  * ``label`` is now optional (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/92)
  * ``allValue`` and ``includeAll`` attributes now available (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/67)

* Add missing ``NULL_AS_NULL`` constant
* Specify the "Instant" for a ``Target`` using the ``instant`` attribute.

Fixes

==================

New features
------------

  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/31, https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/36)
* ``Dashboard`` objects now have an ``auto_panel_id`` method which will
  automatically supply unique panel (i.e. graph) IDs for any panels that don't
  have one set. Dashboard config files no longer need to track their own
  ``GRAPH_ID`` counter.
* Support for ``SingleStat`` panels
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/22)
* ``single_y_axis`` helper for the common case of a graph that has only one Y axis

  ``data_source`` parameter

* Additional fields for ``XAxis``
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/28)
* Get an error when you specify the wrong number of Y axes

  objects is deprecated.
