* Grafana Zabbix plugin support
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/31, https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/36)
* ``Dashboard`` objects now have an ``auto_panel_id`` method which will
  automatically supply unique panel (i.e. graph) IDs for any panels that don't
  have one set. Dashboard config files no longer need to track their own
  ``GRAPH_ID`` counter.
* Support for ``SingleStat`` panels
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/22)
* ``single_y_axis`` helper for the common case of a graph that has only one Y axis

  ``data_source`` parameter

* Additional fields for ``XAxis``
  (https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/pull/28)
* Get an error when you specify the wrong number of Y axes
